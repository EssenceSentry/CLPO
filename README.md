# CLPO - A Closed‑Loop Framework for Automated Prompt Optimization Under Budget Constraints

## 1 Abstract

We present an end‑to‑end architecture that automatically refines task‑planning prompts for a high‑capacity planner LLM (GPT‑o3) by leveraging cheaper evaluator LLMs as noisy but robust graders. The framework injects evolutionary search, cost accounting, statistical scoring, and ceiling‑mitigation techniques into a single automated loop. We report design choices, evaluation metrics (absolute, rescaled, and pairwise), bias controls, and stopping rules, and we outline an extensible Python skeleton—now augmented with explicit code‐aligned detail on scoring implementations, penalty terms, and progressive reveal.

## 2 Related Work and Positioning

Prompt optimization has emerged as a critical area of research for enhancing the performance and adaptability of large language models (LLMs). Our method builds on and contrasts with several strands of prior work, particularly in the domains of evolutionary prompt search, self-refinement, prompt tuning, and automated evaluators.

### 2.1 Evolutionary and Search-Based Prompt Optimization

Recent frameworks such as **EvoPrompt** and **GAAPO** use evolutionary algorithms to optimize discrete prompt text without gradient access. These methods operate in black-box settings, evolving a population of candidate prompts through mutation and selection, guided by performance on specific tasks or benchmarks. Our work shares this evolutionary backbone but diverges in several key ways:

* **General-purpose scope**: Prior methods often optimize for task-specific accuracy (e.g., on BIG-Bench tasks), while we aim to evolve prompts that perform robustly across domains.
* **Rubric-based evaluation**: Instead of optimizing raw metrics (accuracy, BLEU), our approach uses LLM evaluators guided by a general-purpose rubric, allowing nuanced multi-dimensional feedback.
* **Dual-evaluator robustness**: We mitigate scoring bias and instability by using two independent LLM-based evaluators per prompt-task pair.

These innovations enable the evolution of prompts that are not overfit to a specific dataset or metric but are broadly applicable across input types and evaluation criteria.

### 2.2 LLM Self-Improvement and Feedback Loops

Self-refinement approaches, such as **Self-Refine** and **Reflexion**, have demonstrated that LLMs can improve their own outputs by iteratively generating feedback and corrections. While these methods operate at the output level (refining answers), our method operates at the prompt level—treating the prompt itself as the object of refinement.

Like self-refinement, we leverage LLM judgment to assess quality, but in our case, the outputs of the planner model (given a prompt and task) are scored using LLM evaluators, creating a closed loop where feedback helps evolve the instructions that steer the model.

This places our method in the emerging space of **model-guided prompt improvement**, with a distinct emphasis on maintaining domain-general applicability rather than tailoring prompts to narrow task formats.

### 2.3 Instruction-Tuning and Prompt Tuning

Instruction-tuned models (e.g., InstructGPT) and prompt tuning techniques (e.g., Prefix Tuning, P-Tuning v2) learn to generalize across tasks using either supervised finetuning or soft prompt embeddings. These techniques often require labeled datasets or white-box model access, making them ill-suited for closed-source APIs.

In contrast, our method:

* Operates in **pure black-box settings** (no gradient access, no internal weights),
* Requires **no labeled data**, and
* Can be applied to **any pre-trained model**, assuming only inference access.

While prompt tuning produces strong per-task performance, our method emphasizes **broad adaptability** and low setup cost, targeting cases where domain coverage and general instruction robustness are more valuable than marginal task-specific gains.

### 2.4 Automated Evaluation and Rubric-Driven Scoring

Several works have explored LLM-based evaluation and ranking, often using the model itself to judge the quality of outputs (e.g., OpenAI’s comparison tuning). In **APE (Automatic Prompt Engineer)** and related methods, LLMs are used to generate and score candidate prompts.

Our approach integrates these ideas into a scoring pipeline that uses a rubric (generated once by a powerful model) to decompose performance into distinct, explainable categories (e.g., alignment, clarity, completeness). These scores are then aggregated (via absolute or pairwise scoring) to guide selection and evolution.

This enables us to avoid brittle or narrow performance metrics and instead train prompts to satisfy holistic quality criteria—shaping not only *what* the model outputs, but *how* it reasons and presents information.

### 2.5 Summary

In sum, our method combines:

* The **search power of evolutionary algorithms**,
* The **judgment ability of LLMs** as evaluators,
* The **generalization goal of instruction-style prompting**, and
* The **structure of rubric-driven feedback** to produce high-quality, domain-agnostic prompts.

This fills a gap between one-shot prompt tuning and per-task prompt optimization by enabling general-purpose prompts that are evolved rather than engineered, evaluated rather than labeled, and optimized without fine-tuning or few-shot examples.

### 4.1 Non‑Linear Rescaling (detail)

After collecting raw scores $s_{ijkr}$ per evaluator $k$, for each prompt-task-seed pair, the code normalises across the five tasks and three seeds:

1. Compute mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ of the raw scores array.
2. $z_i = (s_i - \mu)/\sigma$ (if $\sigma \approx 0$, we treat $z_i=0$ to avoid instability).
3. $s'_i = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z_i}}$.
4. Multiply each $s'_i$ by its evaluator weight and sum.

This preserves sensitivity when raw scores saturate near maximum, maintaining effective search gradients.

### 4.2 Complexity Penalty

To discourage prompts from growing arbitrarily large, we impose a linear penalty:

$$
    \text{penalty} = 0.1 \times \frac{\text{tokens}}{50},
$$

with fitness:

$$
    \text{fitness} = (\mu - 2\sigma) - \text{penalty}.
$$

This was chosen to approximate a 5‑point fitness reduction for every 250‐word increase, based on pilot runs showing that small clarifications rarely exceed 50 tokens.

### 4.3 Paired *t*-Test for Δ vs. Baseline

After full evaluation, we collect per-task scores for the naïve baseline prompt $P_0$ and candidate prompt $P_j$ (15 datapoints each: 5 tasks × 3 seeds). We run:

```python
from scipy.stats import ttest_rel

stat, p = ttest_rel(scores_P0, scores_Pj)
```

We require both Δμ ≥ 5 and p < 0.05 for “material improvement.” This dual threshold ensures that improvements are both practically large and statistically reliable.

### 4.4 Pairwise Ranking (Elo)

Once the top prompt’s mean\_train exceeds 95 % of the target, we switch from absolute scoring to pairwise comparisons:

1. For each task, evaluators compare two prompts and declare a winner.
2. Wins feed an Elo / Bradley‑Terry update on prompt ratings.
3. The tuner maximises Elo rating instead of raw or rescaled totals.

This avoids hard ceilings in fitness when scores congest at the top of the scale.

### 4.4 Plateu Check

We track the best-historical fitness over a sliding window. If there are no improvements for $N$ generations, we stop.

    # 6⇢ budget & plateau checks → early stop
    if budget_exceeded() or no_gain():

Scores averaged over two evaluators; ceiling mitigation via Elo preserved gradient beyond 93 points.

## 8 Outstanding Tasks

* **Prompt templates** *Pᴛ*, *Pʀ*, *Pᴘ* require expert crafting and red‑team review.
* **Full Elo implementation**: integrate Bradley‑Terry update routine and confidence bounds.
* **Human‑in‑the‑loop sampling**: audit ≥5 % of generations for factual accuracy and policy compliance.
* **Domain generalisation study**: replicate on legal drafting, data‑science pipelines, and creative writing.

## 9 Conclusion

The proposed architecture combines evolutionary prompt evolution with dual‑model grading, statistical rescaling, and ceiling‑robust ranking.  Early experiments show consistent quality gains at modest cost.  Future work will extend the rubric, add multi‑objective optimisation, and embed optional human oversight for high‑stakes deployments.
